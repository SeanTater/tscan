Image tools for speeding up scanning


Requirements
------------
It's not on PyPI yet. (It's not complete enough)

Requires:
    OpenCV (official python binding) (apt: python-opencv)
    GExiv2 (apt: gir1.2-gexiv2-0.4, may vary)

Then in the source package, 
    ./setup.py install

But this isn't a permanent solution (for one thing, you can't uninstall it).
We'll have a PyPI package soon.
